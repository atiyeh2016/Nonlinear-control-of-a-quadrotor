The paper titled "Dynamic modeling and nonlinear tracking control of a novel modified quadrotor" is implemented. In this paper, a nonlinear tracking controller is designed for a novel quadrotor based on Lyapunov stability. The proposed control strategy includes 2 main parts: an attitude controller and a position controller, [1].
